A Processing Library for Leap Motion

This is just a port of the Java example included in the Leap SDK.

To get started, download and unzip into the libraries folder in your Processing sketchbook.
Quit and restart Processing.
Under "File" --> "Examples" there should now be a folder called "LeapJava."
Open the HelloWorld sketch and have at it.
