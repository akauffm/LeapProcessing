LeapProcessing
==============

A Processing Library for Leap Motion

This is a wrapper around the Java example included in the Leap SDK (it works with the latest version 0.7.4, which includes built-in gesture detection).

To get started, download and unzip the repo. Rename the folder "LeapJava" and move it into the libraries folder in your Processing sketchbook.

Quit and restart Processing.

Under "File" --> "Examples" there should now be a folder called "LeapJava."

Open the HelloWorld sketch and have at it.

To make a sketch that does something other than print text, find the section in the onFrame function that outputs the info you're interested in (number of fingers for example).
